    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Pets Purest, a natural pet care brand, needed their Shopify store to align 
      with their brand identity and support their product range. The base theme 
      required customisation to match Figma wireframes, with tailored experiences 
      across product, collection, and informational pages. Third-party apps for 
      reviews, analytics, and conversion needed seamless integration.
    </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Adapted a Shopify 2.0 base theme to align with client needs, implementing 
      custom features and styling refinements across product, collection, and 
      informational pages. Translated Figma wireframes into functional Shopify 
      templates and sections with clean, responsive layouts. Integrated key 
      third-party Shopify apps for reviews, analytics, and conversion tools, 
      ensuring compatibility across the theme.
    </p>

    <h2>The Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      A storefront that reflects Pets Purest's natural, trustworthy brand, with 
      responsive experiences across all major devices. The theme maintains a clean 
      Liquid structure for scalability and ease of content management. App 
      integrations work seamlessly, and the client can manage content without 
      ongoing developer support for routine updates.
