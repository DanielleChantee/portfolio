    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Nutrigums, a supplement and wellness brand, needed their Shopify store to 
      deliver a smooth, conversion-focused user journey. The existing theme lacked 
      responsive polish and seamless integration with key apps for subscriptions, 
      reviews, and product recommendations. Mobile experience needed significant 
      improvement to support their growing customer base.
    </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Implemented responsive design refinements across product, collection, and 
      cart pages to ensure consistent behaviour across devices. Integrated 
      third-party Shopify apps for subscriptions, customer reviews, and 
      recommendation engines, ensuring clean compatibility with the theme. 
      Optimised layout and typography for readability and conversion on mobile, 
      with particular attention to product detail pages and checkout flow.
    </p>

    <h2>The Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      A storefront that delivers a smooth, app-integrated user journey with 
      responsive design across all devices. The theme supports subscriptions, 
      reviews, and recommendations without layout conflicts. Mobile conversion 
      improved with clearer product presentation and streamlined navigation.
