    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Fablight, a lighting and outdoor products brand, needed their Shopify 
      store to have greater theme flexibility and custom functions. The 
      existing theme limited layout options and did not support product 
      presentation requirements such as variant imagery, specification 
      tables, and category-specific layouts. The storefront needed to 
      feel more tailored to their product range.
    </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Enhanced theme flexibility through custom Liquid sections and 
      schema-driven configuration options. Built additional functions 
      including improved variant selectors, product specification 
      blocks, and category-aware layout logic. Refined typography and 
      spacing for better product presentation. Ensured compatibility 
      with existing apps and metafield usage.
    </p>

    <h2>The Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      A storefront with enhanced theme flexibility and custom functions 
      that better support Fablight's product range. The client has 
      greater control over layout and content through the theme editor. 
      Product pages and collection layouts are now tailored to their 
      needs, with improved presentation and usability.
