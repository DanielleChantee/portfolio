    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Fudge Kitchen, a premium dessert brand with a strong retail presence, needed 
      their Shopify store to match the quality of their in-store experience. The 
      default theme constrained layout flexibility, and theme-level bugs were 
      affecting performance and display across devices. The marketing team lacked 
      editorial control over dynamic content blocks.
    </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Direct code modifications across Liquid sections, templates, and settings to 
      tailor the store's layout and behaviour. Resolved theme-level bugs affecting 
      performance and display across devices. Integrated a third-party content 
      management app to control dynamic content blocks within custom sections, 
      giving the marketing team full editorial flexibility without developer 
      involvement for routine updates.
    </p>

    <h2>The Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      A smooth, user-friendly experience aligned with the brand's premium positioning. 
      The store now supports flexible layouts and app-integrated content, with 
      improved performance across devices. The marketing team can manage dynamic 
      content independently, reducing dependency on development for day-to-day updates.
