    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Adios Plastic, a sustainable pet care brand focused on compostable dog bags, 
      needed a custom Shopify implementation that reflected their eco-conscious 
      branding. The store required new layouts, accessible product presentation, 
      and a mobile-first approach.
    </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Designed and developed new layouts using Figma, transforming wireframes into 
      live, fully responsive Shopify pages and sections. Modified core theme code, 
      including sections and templates, to support custom UX patterns, eco-conscious 
      branding, and accessible product presentation. Built with a mobile-first 
      approach to ensure clean, intuitive navigation across all devices.
    </p>

    <h2>The Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      A storefront that aligns with Adios Plastic's sustainability mission, with 
      custom UX patterns and accessible product presentation. The store delivers 
      a clean, intuitive experience across desktop and mobile.
