    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Sims Wear, an apparel and lifestyle brand with a focus on golf and 
      leisure wear, needed ongoing theme support to maintain a seamless 
      customer experience. The store required updates to align with 
      seasonal campaigns, new product launches, and evolving brand 
      guidelines. Existing theme constraints limited flexibility for 
      quick content and layout changes.
    </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Provided theme support including custom section updates, layout 
      refinements, and compatibility fixes with third-party apps. 
      Implemented easy-living improvements such as configurable content 
      blocks and clearer schema options for non-technical staff. 
      Addressed performance and accessibility issues to ensure a 
      smooth experience across devices.
    </p>

    <h2>The Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      A storefront with improved theme support and easier content 
      management. The client can make routine updates without 
      developer involvement. The customer experience remains 
      seamless across product, collection, and campaign pages, 
      with better performance and accessibility.
