    <p>Shopify Theme Redesign</p>

  <div class="project-content case-study">
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Paper Bag Co, a packaging and paper products brand, needed their Shopify 
      store to better showcase their product range with a more dynamic, 
      engaging storefront. The existing layout felt static and did not 
      effectively highlight product categories or seasonal offerings. 
      Responsive behaviour needed improvement for tablet and mobile users.
    </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Redesigned key layouts including homepage, collection, and product 
      templates to create a more dynamic storefront. Implemented responsive 
      features such as flexible grid systems, image optimisation, and 
      touch-friendly navigation. Added custom sections for featured 
      collections and promotional blocks to support marketing campaigns. 
      Ensured consistent spacing and typography across breakpoints.
    </p>

    <h2>The Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      A storefront with redesigned layouts and responsive features that 
      create a dynamic, engaging experience. The store now effectively 
      showcases product categories and supports marketing initiatives. 
      Improved responsive behaviour across devices has led to better 
      engagement and conversion.
