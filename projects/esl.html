    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      ESL, a leading esports organisation, needed their official merchandise store 
      to reflect the energy and scale of their brand. Figma wireframes required 
      accurate translation into responsive Shopify sections and templates, with 
      support for advanced merchandising, reviews, and internationalisation. The 
      existing theme lacked layout flexibility and schema configurability.
    </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Transformed Figma wireframes into responsive Shopify sections and templates, 
      ensuring accurate visual translation across devices. Extended store 
      functionality using third-party Shopify apps for merchandising, reviews, and 
      internationalisation. Refactored and updated theme code to support improved 
      layout flexibility, schema configurability, and mobile-first responsiveness.
    </p>

    <h2>The Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      A storefront that matches ESL's global brand presence, with pixel-perfect 
      implementation across desktop and mobile. The theme now supports flexible 
      layouts, configurable sections for non-developers, and seamless app 
      integration. Internationalisation and merchandising capabilities are in 
      place to support growth across regions.
