    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Floor Story, a flooring and interior design brand, needed their Shopify 
      store to present their stylish floor products in a way that reflected 
      the visual quality of their offerings. Standard theme layouts did not 
      support the product imagery and category structure they required. 
      The store needed modular content blocks for flexible editorial control 
      across product and collection pages.
    </p>

    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Built custom layouts tailored for floor products, with emphasis on 
      large imagery, clear product specifications, and category navigation. 
      Developed modular blocks that allow the client to assemble content 
      sections—hero banners, product grids, and informational blocks—without 
      developer involvement. Implemented schema-driven sections for 
      configurable layouts in the theme editor.
    </p>

    <h2>The Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      A storefront with custom layouts and modular blocks that effectively 
      showcase Floor Story's product range. The client can manage content 
      and layout variations independently. The design supports the brand's 
      focus on style and quality, with improved presentation across 
      product and collection pages.
