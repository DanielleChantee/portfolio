    <h2>Why Work With Me?</h2>
    <p>
      I provide expert Shopify development services that rival high-end agencies

    <h2>How Does This Compare to Agency Fees?</h2>
    <p>
      Shopify agencies typically charge between £100 and £250 per hour, with
      project fees often exceeding £5,000–£10,000 for basic store setups.
      While agencies can bring large teams, this often leads to higher costs
      due to overhead expenses. By working with me directly, you eliminate
      these additional costs while gaining access to a dedicated, experienced
      Shopify developer who focuses on delivering high-quality results.
