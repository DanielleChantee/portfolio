    <h2>Affordable Shopify Developer £50/hour</h2>
    <p>

    <h2>Why Hire Me as Your Shopify Developer?</h2>
    <p>
      At just £50/hour, I provide expert Shopify development services that
      rival those of high-end agencies without the inflated price tag. For
      businesses seeking a professional yet cost-effective solution, I
      deliver quality, flexibility, and personalised attention.

    <h2>How Does This Compare to Agency Fees?</h2>
    <p>
      Shopify agencies typically charge between £100 and £250 per hour, with
      project fees often exceeding £5,000-£10,000 for basic store setups.
      While agencies can bring large teams, this often leads to higher costs
      due to overhead expenses. By hiring me directly, you eliminate these
      additional costs while gaining access to a dedicated, experienced
      Shopify developer who focuses on delivering high-quality results at a
      fraction of the price.
