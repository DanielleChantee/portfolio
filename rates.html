        <h2>Why Hire Me as Your Shopify Developer?</h2>
        <p>
          At just £50/hour, I provide expert Shopify development services that
          rival those of high-end agencies without the inflated price tag. For

    <!-- SHow Does This Compare to Agency Fees? -->

    <div class="about content-section">
      <!-- CONTENT -->
      <div class="content">
        <h2>How Does This Compare to Agency Fees?</h2>
        <p>
          Shopify agencies typically charge between £100 and £250 per hour, with
          project fees often exceeding £5,000-£10,000 for basic store setups.
          While agencies can bring large teams, this often leads to higher costs
          due to overhead expenses. By hiring me directly, you eliminate these
          additional costs while gaining access to a dedicated, experienced
          Shopify developer who focuses on delivering high-quality results at a
          fraction of the price.
