        <p>
          Specialising in frontend engineering for Shopify commerce platforms,
          with extensive experience in custom 2.0 themes, performance-led
          solutions, and scalable storefronts for established and high-growth
          brands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expertise includes performance audits using PageSpeed Insights,
          Lighthouse, and Core Web Vitals; development of complex custom
          sections and metafields; integration of third-party apps and APIs; and
          agile collaboration to deliver robust, maintainable code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently operating within a Shopify Platinum Partner environment,
          focusing on high-impact e-commerce projects where architectural
          decisions support long-term business growth. Valuing clear ownership,
          thoughtful engineering, and systems designed to evolve beyond initial
          launch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Particularly effective in environments where technical decisions have
          long-term commercial impact. Deeply committed to maintainability,
          clear ownership, and systems that withstand growth pressure. Not
          interested in short-term hacks that trade velocity for future
          rewrites.
