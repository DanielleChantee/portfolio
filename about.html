<div class="about content-section">
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      Specialising in frontend engineering for Shopify commerce platforms,
      with extensive experience in custom 2.0 themes, performance-led
      solutions, and scalable storefronts for established and high-growth
      brands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Expertise includes performance audits using PageSpeed Insights,
      Lighthouse, and Core Web Vitals; development of complex custom
      sections and metafields; integration of third-party apps and APIs; and
      agile collaboration to deliver robust, maintainable code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently operating within a Shopify Platinum Partner environment,
      focusing on high-impact e-commerce projects where architectural
      decisions support long-term business growth. Valuing clear ownership,
      thoughtful engineering, and systems designed to evolve beyond initial
      launch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Particularly effective in environments where technical decisions have
      long-term commercial impact. Deeply committed to maintainability,
      clear ownership, and systems that withstand growth pressure. Not
      interested in short-term hacks that trade velocity for future
      rewrites.
