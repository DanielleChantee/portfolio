        <p>
          Product-focused engineering for scalable Shopify commerce systems. My work sits at the intersection of engineering, product thinking, and performance, building scalable, maintainable Shopify solutions for brands operating at scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focus on architecture, long-term extensibility, and implementation decisions that support growth rather than short-term fixes. I've worked across agency and product environments, contributing to complex Shopify builds, custom integrations, and performance-led storefront development through frontend development and technical implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently operating within a Shopify Platinum Partner environment, working on high-impact e-commerce projects where reliability, performance, and quality matter. I value thoughtful engineering, clear ownership, and building things that last.
